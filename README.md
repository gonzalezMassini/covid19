## Description

Web application implemented using React Hooks with the intention to model the trajectory of Covid-19
reported data to help detect when the pandemic is entering a rapid growth phase and when exponential
growth is ending. To visualize the data charts were created using ChartJS. You can interact with the charts by selecting specific data you want to see. Also you can use the country selector to visualize the data on any specific country. The most challenging part of this project was retrieving data from an online API and loading it into my web application. During such struggle I acquired a deep understanding on how API's work and how to display data on the UI with interactive charts.
